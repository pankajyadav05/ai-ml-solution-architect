## Task

1. Implement sentiment analysis in `app.py`.
2. Create a command-line interface in the `main` function.
3. Add error handling and input validation.
4. Implement multi-text analysis with summary statistics.

2. "The quality of the food was terrible. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone."
3. "I can't believe how rude the staff was. They completely ruined my day."
4. "The traffic is horrible today. I'm going to be late for my important meeting."
5. "This product is a complete waste of money. It broke after just one week of use."

## Neutral Samples
